# compression-app
This is a work-in-progress project in where I try to employ the skills i gained from the Machine Learning specialisation course from Coursera to build a simple web app using streamlit where images can be compressed with some more additional functionalities. Updates will be coming soon

after cloning the repo, install streamlit by:
  pip install streamlit

then run:
  streamlit run compression.py

This will open up the implementation of the app locally(the web app has not yet been deployed, hence this is the only way)
